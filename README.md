This folder contains the solutions to the take-home assignment. The assignment is completed in 4 phases and every phase adds new feature to the previous phase(if one exists).

## My process

 ### Phase 1

 This phase represents a single screen android app, which contains a text label, text input and a button. The user interface is built using Android Jetpack Compose library and is implemented within a single composable function

 ### Phase 2

This phase is a progression to the previous phase as it renders the same UI with the help of two composable functions.It also make sure that the 'state' survives configuration change.

 ### Phase 3

 This phase is an updation to the phase2 and it also contains a button which take to the next screen with a list of items. The list item is rendered with the help of Lazy column

 ### Phase 4

 This phase is an updation to the phase3 and it also contains allows to delete a specfic item in the list upon swipe.
